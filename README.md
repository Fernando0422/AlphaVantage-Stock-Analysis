# Stock Analysis API

## Overview

This project is a Flask-based web application that provides real-time stock data and analysis using the Alpha Vantage API. It is designed to showcase integration with external APIs and demonstrate how to build a simple yet functional web service for stock analysis. 

## Features

- Fetches real-time stock data for any given symbol.
- Provides latest stock price and volume.
- Built with Flask and deployed on Heroku.
- Simple and extensible codebase for easy enhancements.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Alpha Vantage API key (You can get it from [Alpha Vantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key))
- Heroku CLI (for deployment)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/stock-analysis-api.git
   cd stock-analysis-api

Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up environment variables:
Create a .env file in the root directory and add your Alpha Vantage API key:

ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY=your_api_key
Running the Application Locally
Run the Flask app:

python app.py
Access the application:
Open your browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000/analyze?symbol=TSLA to see the latest stock data for Tesla.

Deployment to Heroku
Log in to Heroku:
heroku login

Create a Heroku app:
heroku create your-app-name

Set environment variables on Heroku:
heroku config:set ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY=your_api_key --app your-app-name

Deploy the application:
git push heroku main

Access your deployed app:
Open https://your-app-name.herokuapp.com/analyze?symbol=TSLA in your browser.

API Endpoints
GET /analyze
Fetch the latest stock data and analysis for a given symbol.

Query Parameters:

symbol (string): The stock symbol to analyze (e.g., TSLA).
Response:

symbol (string): The stock symbol.
latest_price (string): The latest stock price.
volume (string): The trading volume.
Example:
GET /analyze?symbol=TSLA

Response:
{
  "symbol": "TSLA",
  "latest_price": "231.0000",
  "volume": "4106"
}

Making the Flask App Production-Ready
While this project is currently set up with Flask's development server for simplicity, here are the steps to make it production-ready:
Use a Production WSGI Server: Replace Flask's built-in server with Gunicorn.

Add Gunicorn to requirements.txt:
gunicorn==20.1.0

Update the Procfile:
web: gunicorn app:app
Implement Caching: Use a caching solution like Redis or Memcached to store frequently accessed data.

Asynchronous Processing: Use a task queue like Celery for handling resource-intensive tasks.

Environment Variables: Ensure all sensitive information, such as API keys, are stored securely using environment variables.

Error Handling and Logging: Implement robust error handling and logging to monitor the application's health and performance.

These steps will improve the stability, performance, and scalability of the application in a production environment.
